(a) This is a project about auto-complete widgets in a Swing GUI.
(b) (1) As a user, I can type a partial words and use the auto-complete so that the program can help me complete the rest of the word.
    (2) As a developer, I can adjust the size of the auto-complete window so that the program is more user-friendly

(c) The program doesn't work because it doesn't have a main function.

(d) (1) As a user, I can press ENTER when the word is complete so that I can search the key word on google.
    (2) As a user, I can enter the path of the destination so that I can search the files by the key words I enter before at the destination.

(e) The readme is incomplete becasue the program is incomplete; it doesn't have a project history nor a Usage.

(f) The build.xml is complete up to the compile phase; the program can't be runned because it doesn't have a main. The build.xml has: compile, clean, javadoc, and a test.

(g) Yes we have three issues which add exactly up to 1000.

(h) We probably are not going to add more issues.

(i) The code is organized well. All of the GUI components are put together and it is easy to read. It has some default data in the static. It has a go() method, which set up the layout of the GUI componets. It also has some action listener, including SearchBarKeyListener and SearchBarDocumentListener. There is only one big class which contains several inner classes, so the code is easy to understand. If I were to tell someone else about the code, I would say: There is only one class with several inner listener classes, which might not complete. It doesn't have a main so you need to implement one, but the go() method is ready to use; by calling go() you should have a basic GUI that allows you to input text.

(j) There is a JUnit test target in build.xml but there isn't any actual test files in the project. We should add more unit test such that when a partial text is given, the program should output the correct and complete word accordingly.
